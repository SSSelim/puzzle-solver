# Puzzle Solver
It creates a puzzle of 4x4(0..15) matrix for a given depth. Afterwards, It
solves the puzzle using A\* algorithm. 0 being the star in the matrix.

## Example
- Starting state
```shell
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
13  9 10 12
 0 14 11 15
```
- Goal State
```shell
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
 9 10 11 12
13 14 15  0
```
